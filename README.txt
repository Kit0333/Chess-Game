Project of a chess game by myself with C++ and SDL2 .
You can found the my code and SDL2's code on the project folder to facilitate to everyone to play the game.

You need to download every files and store them in the same folder.
And you compile the code from this folder.

PS :  mingw32-make -f Makefile   (write that in the cdm to compile the code easily)
